i accidentally pushed to the master branch instead of the default main branch ,
While performing these tasks i learnt a lot about shell scripting ,but i still dont understand why we need it as it is a rudimentary programming language i hpope to learn its importance much better 
and the tasks provided were interesting as well as challenging 
i havent done the backdoor challenge as i was busy with other course assignments but i wish to learn more and complete it by the end of next week
i am very curious about path planning algorithms and am looking forward to learn and implement them.
